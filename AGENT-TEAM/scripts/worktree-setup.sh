# Prepares one run's private worktree (WORKFLOW.md, "One worktree per
# run"). Codex runs it from .codex/environments/environment.toml with the
# new worktree as the working directory; a domain run or an interactive
# session runs it by hand after `git worktree add --detach <dir>`, setting
# the same two variables.

# It moves the worktree to a freshly fetched origin/main (Codex starts it
# from whatever origin/main the main checkout last fetched), links in the
# machine's gitignored local files, links the sibling repositories beside
# it so ../elixir-bot/.env and ../cr-agent-api-docs resolve as they do
# from the main checkout, and installs dependencies. Links, never copies,
# for anything secret: a copy of a secrets file is a secret.
